ASSESSMENT LEARNING OUTCOMES 
Upon successful completion of this assessment, you will be able to:  

1.  Demonstrate an understanding of secure programming concepts and techniques.  
2.  Apply  programming  skills  to  manipulate  and  analyse  data  using  popular  libraries  and 

frameworks.  

3.  Demonstrate an understanding of the importance of developing software in an ethical, secure, 

and professional manner.  

4.  Develop technical software solutions for complex problems.  

INSTRUCTIONS 
According  to  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  stroke  is  the  second  leading  cause  of  death 
globally, posing a significant challenge to public health systems. In this assessment, you are required 
to design and develop a secure web-based application for a local hospital to manage a Stroke Prediction 
Dataset. The purpose of the system is to support doctors and healthcare professionals in recording, 
managing, and analysing patient data, covering demographics, medical history, and lifestyle factors, to 
predict the likelihood of a stroke and assist in preventive healthcare. 

Dataset 
You will use the publicly available Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle: 
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data 

Alternatively,  the  dataset  can  be  downloaded  directly  from  the  Moodle  →  Assessment  folder 
provided for this module.

Assessment Tasks 
You must build a secure Python Flask web application that allows users to store, manage, and retrieve 
patient  information  securely  from  the  dataset.  Your  application  should  demonstrate  both  technical 
proficiency and secure software development practices. 

Core Requirements 

1.  Web Application Development 

o  Develop a fully functioning Flask web server with an intuitive and user-friendly interface. 
o 
Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for managing patient 
data. 
2.  Secure Data Management 

o  Support one or more database systems (e.g., SQLite and MongoDB) for secure data 

storage and retrieval. 

o  Separate  databases  may  be  used  to  improve  data  management  and  security  (e.g., 

SQLite for user authentication data, MongoDB for patient records). 

3. 

Implementation of Secure Programming Practices 

o  Apply data encryption (e.g., password hashing or encryption for registration data) to 

protect sensitive information. 

o  Use input validation and sanitisation techniques to prevent vulnerabilities such as 

SQL injection, XSS, or CSRF. 

o  Adopt secure session handling and proper error logging mechanisms. 

4.  Professional and Ethical Development 

o  Demonstrate  awareness  of  ethical  considerations  in  handling  sensitive  healthcare 

data. 

o  Follow  secure  coding  standards  and  professional  programming  conventions 

throughout your implementation. 

5.  Testing and Version Control 

o  Develop unit tests to ensure functional correctness and system reliability. 
o  Utilise  GitHub  for  version  control,  maintaining  clear  documentation  of  commits  and 

development progress to evidence professional software engineering practice.
